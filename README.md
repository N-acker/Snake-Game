This is a simple snake game coded in python.

When the game is being run it automatically starts and the player has control using the arrow keys. 
Each time the snake head touches the apple it grows longer and the score goes up. 
If the snake head touches any of the borders of the screen or its own body the game is over.

In this project I learned how to utilize the window so that any user can control the functions within a game.
